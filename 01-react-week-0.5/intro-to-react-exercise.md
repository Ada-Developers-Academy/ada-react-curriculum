> Create React App is a tool (built by developers at Facebook) that gives you a massive head start when building React apps. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and Create React App sets up the tools you need to start your React project.

_Taken from the [Team Treehous Blog](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-create-react-app-tool)_

Essentially `create-react-app` is a too that generates a starter react application with a bunch of tooling and configuration already done for you.  It's a lot better than manually setting it all up yourself.

CRA Provides:

- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

##### !question

Why is the following react render function invalid?

    ```JavaScript
      function App() {
        return (
          <header>
            <h1>Hello Neat Header</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Welcome to my React application!

##### !explanation

In a React component you need to return a **single** element.  You can have other JSX inside that element, but you React requires you to return a single JSX element, which can contain other elements.

This could be fixed with:

    ```JavaScript
      function App() {
        return (
          <div>
            <header>
              <h1>Hello Neat Header</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
              Welcome to my React application!
          </p>
          </div>
        );
      }
    ```

##### !explanation

`class` is a reserved word in JavaScript, so you need to replace it with `className` in JavaScript.

The next two questions involve using this [coding sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ada-initial-react-ub6v9?file=/src/App.js), which is kind of like CodePen or Repl.it, but lets you write client-side JavaScript (including React) and see it immediately in the browser.

Open up the Codepen and try the following challenges.

5. Add another `img` tag to your render function to an image of your choice. The image source should be an absolute URL from an image already uploaded on the internet.

6. **Challenge**: Create a local variable in your `App` function equal to your name. Update the function to display the value associated with this local variable.
